Fitness Health App

This project uses GetX and follows a feature-first architecture.
For security reasons, only my email was added during testing.
If you want to test the code yourself, please share your email with me so I can add it to the Google account.
Due to limited time, the setup for all users has not been completed.

I initially used the health package since it offered a unified API for both Google Fit and Apple Health.
However, due to the recent Google Fit deprecation and migration towards Health Connect, several restrictions and permission issues occurred.
To overcome these limitations and ensure stable integration, I decided to use the Google Fit API directly instead as per assignment.
